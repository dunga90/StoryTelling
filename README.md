# StoryTelling
The excel file is in the "Episode1" folder

I am currently looking for a new jobs, where I can improve my coding skills and reach my goals in this field. During this searching period I realized I am just a set of keywords to the companies, headhunters and other HR related people. For the first time I was very angry because I knew I am more than tags, which can be hung on the people. But after the first feeling, I started to think about it and to observe the other side of the coin, which is ME. And here is the consequence: maybe the reason, why I am just a set of keywords, is I only use templates. My CV is a template, where I use the same sentences, words, figure of speech etc.. So I realized I am the part of the problem. But we know the first step to solve a problem is the knowing the problem and after that we can think about solution. My solution is StoryTelling.
I will share different fictive stories on my GitHub site with you. These stories  will always have several episodes.which present one part of my current knowledge. What I will focus on:
  •	VBA coding
  •	SQL (most of the cases in Access)
  •	Visualization (power BI, Power View etc.)
The goals of these StoryTelling thing are:
  •	to improve my coding knowledge
  •	to share my knowledge - participate in exciting projects
  •	to learn - get advises
  •	to encourage people to start to tell their own stories 
  •	to improve my English
If you are not so bored at this point,  check my GitHub site, the episodes and sotries, share your opinion.
