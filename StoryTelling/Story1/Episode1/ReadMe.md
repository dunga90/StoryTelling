    1, Filtering:
        After the numbers in the FIRST column you can set up, which fields would you like to filter on. (Title, Author etc...). Please             NOTE!: you can use one filed just ONCE by a filtering.
        SECOND column: you can set up the parameter of the filter. Eg.: By the Title - Begins with or By the Average_rating - Less than.           NOTE!: by the language_code you do NOT need to write any data in the third column.
        THIRD column: You can put here, what you would like to filter on.
     After you finished the set up of the filters you just need to click on Filtering button.
